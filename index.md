## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="Tongxin.jpeg">

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Indiana University Bloomington. I am currently advised by Dr. Kun Huang from IU School of Medicine. Before moving to IU, I spent one year studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University. I received my B.S. in Physics from Fudan University in 2016.

My research interests lies in the area of biomedical informatics, where I utilize machine learning algorithms to solve biomedical problems. My main focus is on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis and medical imaging data analysis. I am currently interested in developing deep learning algorithms for understanding scRNA-seq data and effectively extracting biological insights.
